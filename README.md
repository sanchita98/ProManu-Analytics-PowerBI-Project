📊 ProManu Analytics Dashboard
Case Study: Enhancing Manufacturing Efficiency Through Data-Driven Insights
🔍 Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end manufacturing data analysis using Power BI, aimed at uncovering key insights from production and employee datasets. As a data analyst at ProManu Analytics, you are tasked with exploring two distinct but interconnected datasets—Manufacturing Production Data and Employee Performance Metrics—to help improve operational efficiency, cost control, and employee productivity.

🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Uncover insights related to production cost trends, employee performance, and resource allocation.

Identify the relationship between workforce metrics and manufacturing outcomes.

Provide data-driven recommendations to improve manufacturing efficiency.
